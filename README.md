# Synchronized-Methods
At this task I created class ATM which has 2 methods: withdrew and top up.
Method "withdrew" decreases amount of money of ATM.
Method "top up" increases amount of money of ATM.
I also created 5 threads. Each of thread represents a client. 
The problem of this task was how to synchronize both methods.
See realization in the files Main and ATM.
